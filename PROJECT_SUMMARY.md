# Gemini Discord Bot - Project Summary

## 📋 What Was Created

A complete, production-ready Discord bot powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 AI with advanced personalization features.

## 🎯 Key Improvements Over Original llmcord

### New Features
1. **Per-Server Model Selection** - Each server can choose its own Gemini model

7. **Fixed Streaming Bug** - Improved chunk buffering and rate limiting prevents mid-stream cutoffs
8. **Persistent Storage** - All settings saved in JSON files per server

### Architectural Improvements
1. **Simplified Codebase** - Removed multi-provider complexity, focused only on Gemini
2. **Better Data Management** - Proper async file I/O with locking mechanisms
3. **Enhanced Error Handling** - More robust error recovery and logging
4. **Improved Streaming** - Better buffering and Discord API rate limit handling

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **discord.py** (≥2.6.0) - Discord API wrapper
- **google-generativeai** (≥0.8.0) - Official Gemini SDK
- **pyyaml** (≥6.0) - YAML configuration parsing
- **aiofiles** (≥23.0.0) - Async file operations

### Python Version
- Python 3.13 (Docker)
- Python 3.10+ recommended (local)

### Storage
- JSON files in `server_data/` directory
- One file per server/DM
- Automatic creation and cleanup
- Thread-safe with async locks

### Performance

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why JSON over Database?
- Lightweight and portable
- No external dependencies
- Easy to backup and inspect
- Sufficient for most use cases
- Can be migrated to DB later if needed

### Why Per-Server Storage?
- Privacy isolation between servers
- Easier to manage and debug
- Users can have different personas per server
- Simpler permissions model

### Why Gemini Only?
- Focused feature set
- Better integration with Google Search
- Simpler codebase to maintain
- Native vision and search support
- More recent models

### Why Streaming?
- Better user experience
- Feels more responsive
- Shows progress on long responses
- Industry standard for LLM interfaces

## 📊 Configuration Options

### Essential Settings
```yaml
bot_token: "required"
client_id: "required"
gemini_api_key: "required"
```

### Customizable Limits
```yaml
max_text: 100000
max_images: 5
max_messages: 25
max_urls: 3
max_user_description_length: 500
```

### Behavior Options
```yaml
enable_search_grounding: true
use_plain_responses: false
allow_dms: true
```

### Permission System
```yaml
permissions:
  users:
    admin_ids: []
    allowed_ids: []
    blocked_ids: []
  roles:
    allowed_ids: []
    blocked_ids: []
  channels:
    allowed_ids: []
    blocked_ids: []
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**
   - Config.yaml is in .gitignore
   - Never commit tokens to Git
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **User Privacy**
   - Users can view their own data
   - Users can delete their descriptions
   - Data is server-isolated
   - No external analytics

3. **Permission System**
   - Role-based access control
   - Admin-only commands
   - Channel/user blocking
   - DM permission control

4. **API Safety**
   - Built-in rate limiting
   - Error recovery
   - Timeout handling
   - Safe defaults

## 📈 Scalability

### Current Limits
- **Servers**: Unlimited (one JSON file each)
- **Users per Server**: Unlimited
- **Concurrent Conversations**: Limited by API rate limits
- **Message Cache**: Auto-cleans at 500 nodes

### Optimization Tips
1. Reduce `max_messages` for large servers
2. Use Flash model for high-volume servers
3. Disable search if not needed
4. Use plain responses for lower memory usage
5. Restart periodically if needed

### Future Scaling Options
- Migrate to SQLite/PostgreSQL for very large deployments
- Add Redis for distributed caching
- Implement message queue for high throughput
- Add monitoring and analytics

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Gemini API Restrictions**
   - Rate limits apply (varies by plan)
   - Some regions may have limited access
   - Model availability may change

2. **Discord API Limits**
   - 2000 character limit for plain text
   - 4096 character limit for embeds
   - Rate limits on edits (handled by bot)

3. **Storage**
   - JSON files grow with users
   - No automatic archival
   - Manual backup recommended

4. **Features Not Included**
   - Multi-language support (can be added in prompts)
   - Voice channel integration
   - Scheduled messages
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Web interface
