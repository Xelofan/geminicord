## Data Storage

### Server Data Structure

Each server's data is stored in `server_data/{server_id}.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
  "system_prompt": "Custom prompt here...",
  "users": {
    "user_id": {
      "display_name": "Username",
      "description": "User's self-description",
      "first_seen": "2025-10-07T12:34:56Z",
      "last_updated": "2025-10-07T12:34:56Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### DM Data Structure

DM conversations are stored in `server_data/dm_{user_id}.json` with a similar structure.

## Features in Detail

### Google Search Grounding

When enabled, the bot can search the web to provide up-to-date information:
- Automatically activates when needed
- Provides source citations
- Configurable in `config.yaml`

### Automatic User Discovery

The bot automatically:
1. Detects new users in conversations
2. Records their display name
3. Updates names when changed
4. Tracks first interaction and last update

### Streaming Responses

Responses appear in real-time:
- Orange embed = generating
- Green embed = complete
- Automatically splits long responses
- Fixed: No more mid-stream cutoffs!

### Image Support

The bot can process images from:
- Discord attachments (uploaded images)
- External URLs in messages
- GIF images (first frame)

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding
- Check MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT is enabled
- Verify bot token and API key are correct
- Check permission settings in config.yaml

### Streaming stops mid-way

- If it still occurs, check your internet connection
- Try using `use_plain_responses: true` as a workaround

### Permission errors
- Ensure admin IDs are correct in config.yaml
- Check that the user has the necessary Discord permissions

### Images not working
- Verify URLs are direct links to images
- Check that max_images setting isn't set to 0
- Ensure the Gemini model supports vision
